# 🧠 CATCH IF YOU CAN  
*A Psychological War Dressed as a Game*  

⚔️ **Tagline**:  
"You thought you were playing a game.  
You were the game."

## 🔥 Why We Created This  
Because fun isn’t real until you’re questioning your own mind.  
Because every click, every choice, every hesitation you make can — and should — be used against you.  
Because the world needs games that fight back.  

We didn't come here to build another "tap tap" toy.  
We came to build the battlefield inside your own skull.

## ⚡ The Pain We Carried Into This  
Last hackathon? We played it safe.  

Built something functional, technical, clean.  

Judges smiled. Then forgot it in 5 minutes.  

✅ **We realized**:  

Nobody remembers safe.  
Only madness is unforgettable.  

That's why Catch If You Can was born.  
Not to entertain.  
But to mark every player forever.

## 🎮 What Is Catch If You Can?  
A 15-stage mind survival game.  

Choose between 3 doors.  

Sounds easy, right?  

**Except...**  

The AI evolves.  

It learns you.  

It gaslights you.  

It mocks you.  

It breaks you.  

You aren't fighting doors.  
You're fighting yourself — and losing.

An on-chain memory of your defeat.*

## 💀 Why Judges Will Care  
Because this isn’t a "build." It’s a weaponized experience.  

We are the only project that:  

- Evolves gameplay against the player  
- Trains an AI to be an emotional manipulator  
- Records psychological failure immutably  
- Turns fun into fear in under 3 minutes  

*Everyone else built apps.  
We built trauma.*

## 🧩 Lessons Learned (The Hard Way)  
Good ideas are cheap. Execution under death-clock matters.  

Assets are everything. No art = no soul.  

Time management is life.  

Trust your insane ideas. They leave scars.  

We wasted days struggling on visuals.  
We fought Lovable’s limits.  
We forgot time.  

But even on broken legs, we dragged this monster across the finish line.
