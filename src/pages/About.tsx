            <p className="mb-4">
              Door of Illusions is a psychological game that tests your ability to detect deception and make decisions 
              under pressure. You face an AI-powered opponent that adapts to your gameplay style and attempts to 
              manipulate your choices.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The game is inspired by cognitive science research on decision-making, the psychology of deception, 
              and game theory. As you progress through the 15 increasingly challenging stages, you'll encounter an 
              AI grandmother character who evolves from a helpful guide to a manipulative adversary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your objective is to select the correct door while learning to interpret the AI's increasingly deceptive hints. 
              The game tracks your trust level, win/loss ratio, and other metrics to create a personalized experience that 
              adapts to your play style.

                  The game explores how quickly players form trust relationships and how they respond 
                  when that trust is betrayed. The AI adapts its deception tactics based on your trust level.

                  Players must constantly weigh the risks and rewards of trusting the AI's advice versus
