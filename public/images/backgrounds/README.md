# Background Images

This directory contains background images for different game stages.

## Naming Convention

Files should be named using the format: `stage{number}.jpg`

For example:
- `stage1.jpg` - Background for Stage 1
- `stage2.jpg` - Background for Stage 2
- ...
- `stage15.jpg` - Background for Stage 15

## Recommended Image Properties

- Resolution: At least 1920x1080px
- Format: JPG or WEBP (for better compression)
- Theme should match the intensity and psychological aspects of each stage:
  - Stages 1-3: Lighter, less threatening environments
  - Stages 4-6: Moderate intensity, slightly unsettling
  - Stages 7-9: Dark, more ominous environments
  - Stages 10-15: Very dark, psychologically disturbing environments

If these images are not provided, the system will fall back to color gradients defined in the CSS.
